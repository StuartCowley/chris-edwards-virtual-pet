Welcome to Alien Invasion!

Alien Invasion is a fun and engaging app that allows you to create and manage your own alien being. You can choose the name and species of your alien, level it up, and unlock new special abilities as you progress. You can also have your alien reproduce and raise a family of little alien babies.

To start using Alien Invasion, simply create an instance of the Alien class and customize your alien's properties. You can then use the isAlive() method to check whether your alien is still alive, and the levelUp() method to level up your alien and unlock new abilities.

As you play, be sure to keep an eye on your alien's hunger and fitness levels. If your alien becomes too hungry or too fat, it may not survive for long. You can use the feed() and exercise() methods to help your alien stay healthy and strong.

We hope you enjoy playing Alien Invasion! Happy alien-raising!
